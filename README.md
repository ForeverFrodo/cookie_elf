# Cookie Elf 🧝
🍪 Cookies are getting claimed for Christmas! For each cookie claimed, one must give a gift to another, and another will give thee a gift. So simple.

Simply pass in a list of names at the top of `CookieElf.py`, and the Cookie Elf will assign each participant their list of gift assignments. So simple.

But wait... the algorithm is not quite right!! Find the problem, make it statistically sound, and submit a PR to save the day! 📊🎁
